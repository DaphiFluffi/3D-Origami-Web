# 3D-Origami-Web
My bachelor's thesis on creating an interactive application that helps users trying to teach themselves how to build 3D Origami figurines.  
It is split into 3 parts:  
  1. Animated Tutorial on how to fold the basic 3D Origami piece. 
  2. Video Tutorial on the different ways to connect 3D Origami pieces together to make models.
  3. The 3D Origami Generator that lets you generate and color models in any size you want. You are able to create increased, decreased and inverted rows.
